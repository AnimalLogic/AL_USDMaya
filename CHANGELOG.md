For now this is checked at run-time allowing you to enable/disable it to switch between the different selection modes. Note: this UFE selection is supported in the old VP1 code and also in VP2. When UFE selection is enabled, perform an extra wireframe draw to show selection.
* Implemented VP2 selection, so the env var MAYA_VP2_USE_VP1_SELECTION is no longer required.
* Set proper version in Maya plugin.

### Deprecated
* MAYA_VP2_USE_VP1_SELECTION is no longer required for Maya 2019+

* Rendering of Wireframe selected objects
* Transform Import now respects single float rotations
* Transform orders that do not match maya's order are now correctly imported.
* Failing tests were crashing maya
* Ask DG iterator to traverse over world space dependents. Without this change, for a typical skin deformer, traversal ends at all upstream joints. And MAnimUtil::isAnimated failed to detect it is an animated joint, which is not too unexpected. After setTraversalOverWorldSpaceDependents(), those ctrl and srt nodes will be traversed and detected as animated.
* Clear the xformOps when copying attributes during exporting to avoid crashing Maya.
* Pick the first exportable shape to export and ignore the others when there are multiple shapes under a transform, and "mergeTransforms" flag is turned on on AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand.
* Fix the primvar normal mismatch warnings by setting interpolation to "vertex" for normals attribute.
Overs are no longer applied to prims by selecting them in the viewport.
* Animated caches were no longer animating in the viewport - fixed by setting the time in the draw method (rather than the now infrequently called prepareForDraw method)
* The mesh translator does not respect the internal exporting mesh params.

## v0.29.2 (2018-09-21)

### Added

* Sub-sample animation export

### Changed

* Plugins' metadata (`plugInfo.json`) have been moved to **lib/usd** to reflect USD's new layout.
* The initial edit target of proxyShapes has changed from the root layer to the session layer (#102 - @[nxkb](//github.com/nxkb))
* The mapping from prim to maya dag path is no longer stored on the session layer, but is stored on the proxyShape class (#102 - @[nxkb](//github.com/nxkb))
* Made translatorProxyShape into a completely separate plugin, AL_USDMayaPxrTranslators (#109 - @[elrond79](//github.com/elrond79))
* This sandboxes the main AL_USDMayaPlugin from needing to link against any pixar maya libraries (ie, usdMaya) (#109 - @[elrond79](//github.com/elrond79))
* Also added a cmake option to disable building of the plugin entirely, BUILD_USDMAYA_PXR_TRANSLATORS (#109 - @[elrond79](//github.com/elrond79))
* Updated FindUSD.cmake to enable finding of usdMaya (#109 - @[elrond79](//github.com/elrond79))

### Changed

* TranslatorAbstract::import(), a third parameter is added to pass out Maya object created in importing process. This interface will be used in both AL_usdmaya_Import and AL_usdmaya_ProxyShapeImport workflows and TranslatorContext need be checked before using.
* A third argument is added to macro AL_USDMAYA_DEFINE_TRANSLATOR. It must be an array of MayaFnTypeId which defines all Maya object types this translator might export.
* Selection(is stored preFileSave() in a MSelectionList, not storing AL_USD proxies (#78 - @[wnxntn](//github.com/wnxntn))
* Selection is restored postFileSave() (#78 - @[wnxntn](//github.com/wnxntn))

* Transform values that have not changed no longer get written back to USD.
* Only hook up the proxy shape time attribute to the transform nodes that are actually transforms (i.e. ignore prims that are effectively just organisational containers)
* Allowed named events to be able to have callbacks registered against them prior to the events being registered

### Removed

* Some export macros from inline methods

### Fixed

* Regression where transform values were no longer being correctly displayed when translating prims into maya.
* A number of build warnings in the OSS build
* Final two build warnings in the repo. The generated schema code needs to have a flag set in the build C4099 to hide the 'class defined as struct' warning (pixar issue, not ours)
* When you duplicate a proxy shape, you wont see anything in the viewport and it wont be fully initialize until you reopen maya or find a hack (like changing the usd path) to trigger a load stage. (#98 - @[nxkb](//github.com/nxkb))

### Added
* Documentation for mesh export, interpolation modes, and diffing.
* "-fd" flag added to the import command and the translate command
* Support for prim var interpolation modes in the import/export code paths (currently UV sets only, colour sets & normals will be in a later PR).

* Built using USD-0.8.5
* ProxyShapePostLoadProcess::createTranformChainsForSchemaPrims now checks all the prims' parents' metadata for their unmerged status. If found, the transform chain creation skips the current prim in place of its parent.
* ProxyShapePostLoadProcess::createSchemaPrims now checks all the prims' parents' metadata for their unmerged status. If found, the schema prim import will instead take place under the parent node.
* Mesh::import now checks the prim's parents' metadata for its unmerged status. If found, the created shape node will not have the appended "Shape" string.
* Mesh attributes queries use EarliestTime timecode
* Functions in DgNodeTranslator are moved to DgNodeHelper in AL_USDMayaUtils
* AttributeType.h/.cpp are moved to AL_USDMayaUtils
* LayerManager API has been updated so you can now inspect all layers that have been set as an EditTarget and are Dirty.
* Updated endToEndMaya tutorial to work with latest USD API changes.
* All hard coded /tmp paths in the unit tests, in favour of a linux/win32 solution.

### Fixed

* Fix for when tearing down a shape, that it's sibling shapes are left alone in Maya.
* time1.outTime is now connected to proxy shape nodes when transforms are selected during creation.
* Selected transforms are no longer renamed when importing a proxy shape.
* Tests build restored.
* Fix for Issue "meshTransform cannot execute twice" #82
* Bug in the import/export of mesh normals
* Normals export now correctly listen to the exporter options.
* AL_usdmaya_plugin can be unloaded correctly.
* Passing the time value into the nurbs, camera, and transform translators on export.

### Removed
* Removed the code that reversed polygon windings if the 'leftHanded' meta data flag was encountered. Instead, the 'opposite' flag is set on the maya mesh.

## v0.27.10 (2018-05-07)

### Added

* A new plugin translator (translator/NurbsCurve.cpp) to translate prim between USD and Maya, and write back editing result to USD prim.

### Changed

* Existing static nurbs curve translator re-uses common utils code.

### Fixed

* Windows build

## v0.27.8 (2018-05-02)

### Changed

* ExportCommand will now export time samples for the visibility attribute.
* ImportCommand will now correctly import time samples for the visibility attribute.

## v0.27.7 (2018-05-01)

### Removed

* Qt dependency (Thanks to Sebastien Dalgo from Autodesk)

## v0.27.6 (2018-04-13)

### Added

* New attribute "assetResolverConfig" on proxy shape
* Export creates master geometry prim thus each instance could reference. If transform and mesh nodes are separated by turning off "mergeTransform" option, transform prim will be marked as "instanceable" and fully benefits from usd instancing feature.
* Import detects shared master geometry prim, ensures maya transform nodes parenting the instancing shape.
* Layer manager is now serialised on file export

## v0.27.5 (2018-04-10)

### Added

* Add assetResolverConfig string attribute to ProxyShape

### Changed

* Built against USD-0.8.4
* Move initialisation of maya event handler from AL_USDMaya library to mayaUtils library

## v0.27.4 (2018-04-04)

### Added

* src/plugin/AL_USDMayaTestPlugin/AL/usdmaya/fileio/export_unmerged.cpp has been added, which tests the mergeTransforms parameter.

### Changed

* src/schemas/AL/usd/schemas/plugInfo.json.in had the metadata "al_usdmaya_mergedTransform" added.
* src/plugin/AL_USDMayaTestPlugin/AL/usdmaya/test_DiffPrimVar.cpp had the export parameter mergeTransforms changed to 1 to revert to previous test behaviour.
* fileio/Import.cpp will now check for the mergedTransform metadata on the parent transform, which prevents mesh import from creating the parent transform.
* fileio/Export.cpp has re-enabled functionality for "mergeTransforms", which will export the Xform prim and then the children mesh prims separately when set to '0'. The parent transform will have the metadata "al_usdmaya_mergedTransform = unmerged" added to tag it as an unmerged node.

## v0.27.3 (2018-03-29)

### Added

* Add -eac/-extensiveAnimationCheck option to AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand
* Add isAnimatedTransform() to AnimationTranslator to perform extensive animation check on transform nodes.

### Changed

* Updated Inactive/Active tests
* By default AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand will perform extensive animation check.
* Changed the signature of StageCache::Get(bool forcePopulate) to remove forcePopulate as it doesn't exist in the USDUtilsCache. Also affects Python bindings

### Fixed

* Mesh surface normals were not importing correctly

## v0.27.2 (2018-03-27)

### Added

* Internal AL build fixes
* Small fix to nurb width import

## v0.27.1 (2018-03-23)

### Added

* Updated existing command to add layer to the RootLayers sublayer stack
* Support relative path as usd file path, which will be resolved using current maya file path. It does nothing if current maya file path is none.
* Renamed glimpse subdivision related tokens (from glimpse_name to glimpse:subdiv:name)
* Nurb Curve widths now are imported and exported from AL_USDMaya's ImportCommand
* rendererPlugin attribute to ProxyShape
* Mesh Translation tutorial

### Changed

* Built using USD-0.8.3
* Library name AL_Utils -> AL_EventSystem
* Use custom data to store maya_associatedReferenceNode instead of attribute on the prim when import maya reference.
* AL_usdmaya_ProxyShapeImportPrimPathAsMaya, removed the parameters which weren't used.
* Allow for custom pxr namespace - https://github.com/AnimalLogic/AL_USDMaya/pull/68

### Fixed

* "Error : No proxyShape specified/selected " when attempting to add a sublayer via the UI
* The MPLug::source()  error in Maya 2016, the API is only available since Maya 2016 ex2.
* Failing unit test
* AL_usdmaya_TranslatePrim now ignores translation to an already translated prim
* Crash fix for MeshTranslator crash when variant switching
* Fixes several issues with selection in the maya viewport - https://github.com/AnimalLogic/AL_USDMaya/pull/42

## v0.27.0 (2018-03-12)

### Added
* Mesh Translation: Add support for glimpse user data attributes during import / export
* Added a Translate command "AL_usdmaya_TranslatePrim" that allows you to selectively run the Translator for a set of Prim Paths to either Import or Teardown the prim. Tutorial on the way!
* preTearDown writes Meshes Translated to Maya to EditTarget
* Library Refactor: Refactored to seperate code into multiple libraries: see change [DeveloperDocumentation](README.md#developer-documentation)

* Tests: TranslatorContext.TranslatorContext was failing because there was an extra insert into the context in the MayaReference import. Also there was a filter on the tests which needed to be nuked!
* Docs: Small update to build.md
* Mesh Translation: updated glimpse subdivision attribute handling
* Store maya_associatedReferenceNode in custom data This is to stop USD from complaining about: "Error in 'pxrInternal_v0_8__pxrReserved__::UsdStage::_HandleLayersDidChange' at line 3355 in file stage.cpp : 'Detected usd threading violation.  Concurrent changes to layer(s) composed in stage 0x185f5a50 rooted at @usdfile.usda@.  (serial=6, lastSerial=12).'
* Updated AL_usdmaya_LayerCreateLayer command to add layers to Sublayers
* Proxy Shape and transform nodes names now match
* Update to USD-0.8.3


### Known Bugs/Limitations:
* Variant Switch with Maya Meshes causes a crash
* AL_usdmaya_TranslatePrim generates multiple copies of meshes
* AL_usdmaya_ProxyShapeImportPrimPathAsMaya not using new Mesh Translation functionality



## v0.26.1 (2018-03-02)

### Added

* Doxygen comments, tutorial and unit test for ModelAPI::GetLock(), ModelAPI::SetLock() and ModelAPI::ComputeLock().


### Changed

Change default lock behaviour of al_usdmaya_lock metadata. "transform" will lock current prim and all its children.
* GetSelectabilityValue method is now called GetSelectability
* Implementation of ComputeLock() is modified to reuse common code structure.
* Library name AL_Utils -> AL_EventSystem


### Fixed

* Issue with the ProxyShapeIimport command not loading payloads correctly.
* AL_USDMayaSchema's pixar plugin was not being loaded during it's tests
* Blocked the usd stage being reloaded when the filePath changes, when loading a maya file. This ensures all proxy shape attributes are initialised prior to reloading the stage.
* Crash when moving a locked prim
* Locking not working on maya hierarchies that appear and disappear on selection
* "Error : No proxyShape specified/selected " when attempting to add a sublayer via the UI

## v0.26.0 (2018-02-09)

### Added

* Overloads for the MPxTransform::isBounded() and MPxTransform::boundingBox() methods to provide the transforms with a bounding box to enable usage of frame selected
* ProxyShape::usdStage() to directly return the proxys shape stage without triggering a compute
* Extended Python bindings for ProxyShape class
* Flag to keep temporary test files generated by AL_USDMayaTestPlugin

### Changed

* Uses USD-0.8.2
* Reduced the overall number of pulls on the outStage data attribute
* Replaced the use of MMessage callbacks in favour of a scheduled system allowing control of maya events over a number of plugins and tools
* the -identifiers/-id flag is set.  This makes it more in line with all the other flags for the command (and more
  flexible), but is a change in behavior - previously, the muted layers would ALWAYS be returned as identifier
* Removed QT dependency in favour of Maya's keyboard getModifiers command
* Total revamp of how layers and edited layers are stored by AL_USDMaya

### Removed

* The insertFirst / insertLast concept in the maya events system

### Fixed

* Incorrect spot cone angles were being passed to Hydra in VP2
* Animated attributes could end up being added to the export list multiple times
* Ik chains needed to be inspected to ensure the animated values were correctly exported
* Animation caused via geometry constraints would not be exported
* regression that printed out various malformed sdfpath errors in unit tests
* Add AL pkgutil fallback for environments without pkg_resources
* ProxyShapeImport command now correctly takes `ul` parameter to direct if it should load payloads or not
* Bug where it was possible to select a transform outside the proxyshape using the 'up' key
* Bug with CommandGuiHelper where if it has errors building it would stay hidden, it now deletes and rebuilds itself
* Bug where addListOption would error if any list items had any characters that need to be quoted
* Crash when a prim is selected multiple times via command
* Crash if set xform values on an invalid prim
* Crash when pushToPrim is triggered but the prim is invalid
* Crash fix for when switching back + forth between a usd-camera and a maya-referenced camera

## v0.25.0 (2017-11-28)

### Added

* New metadata and logic to lock transform and disable pushToPrim.
* A boolean option "meshUV" or "muv" in AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand to indicate only export mesh uv data to a scene hierarchy with empty over prims.
* A boolean option "leftHandedUV" or "luv" in AL_usdmaya_ExportCommand to indicate whether to adjust uv indices orientation. This option only works with "meshUV"

### Changed

* Add special rules for some Maya-USD attribute type mismatches so the maya attribute values transfer correctly to USD prim, e.g. interpolateBoundary attribute on mesh.
* When translate, rotate, scale attributes are locked, TransformationMatrix blocks any changes of these attributes.
* In mesh import, leftHanded flag retrieved from USD will also decide if uv indices need be adjusted.

### Removed

* Host Driven Transforms
